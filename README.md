# Deep LSTM siamese network for text similarity

It is a tensorflow based implementation of deep siamese LSTM network to capture sentence similarity using word embeddings.

For the task mentioned above it uses a multilayer siamese LSTM network and euclidian distance based contrastive loss to learn input pair similairty.

# Capabilities
Given adequate training pairs, this model can learn Semantic as well as structural similarity. For eg:

- He is smart = He is a wise man.
- Someone is travelling countryside = He is travelling to a village.
- She is cooking a dessert = Pudding is being cooked.
- Microsoft to acquire Linkedin â‰  Linkedin to acquire microsoft

(More examples Ref: semEval dataset)

For Sentences, the model uses **pre-trained word embeddings** to identify semantic similarities.

Categories of pairs, it can learn as similar:
- Annotations
- Abbreviations
- Extra words
- Similar semantics
- Typos
- Compositions
- Summaries

# Training Data
	- A sample set of learning sentence semantic similarity can be downloaded from:

	"train_snli.txt" : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1itu7IreU_SyUSdmTWydniGxW-JEGTjrv

	This data is generated using SNLI project : 
	> https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/

	 - word embeddings: any set of pre-trained word embeddings can be utilized in this project. For our testing we had used fastText 	simple english embeddings from https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md
